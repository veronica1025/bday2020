                <p> Babe!!, yes i agree...i agree that i get jealous sometimes..or even i'm possessive for you..yes i am..but you know why?! 'cause i think people are scary, they are not good..especially girls..most of them just do,what they want to do and that's why i sometimes feel that someone might steal you away forever ;( ..yr even best friend can feel insecure when you get close to someone else.Also i really don't want ki koi tumhe hurt kare ab yr..
                </p>
                <p>But that doesn't mean that you can't have any other female friend ;-D , you are allowed to have..but here's a condition,that you just gotta love me more alwayssss ;-D</p>
